- 👋 Hi, I’m @BobSandelman
- 👀 I’m interested in developing an electronic version of my "Crossword Calendar", a perpetual wall calendar that I invented and patented several years ago. This calendar consists of a unique 9 by 8 grid of letters and numbers representing the 3-letter abbreviations of each of the 12 months, 3-letter abbreviations for each day of the week, plus numbers 1 through 31. Like a crossword puzzle, some months/days/dates are horizontal and others are vertical.  All 72 characters in the grid are used at least once during a year with no "fillers". The concept is similar to the Biegert & Funk Qlocktwo electronic word clock but even better because the Qlocktwo reads only horizontally and includes several "filler" characters in its grid. An electronic version of the "Crosword Calendar" would change the highlighted date at midnight each day. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for someone to apply the same technology used in the Qlocktwo to develop an electronic version of the "Crossword Calendar". I am  not a coder.
